In JavaScript, memory management is handled automatically by the browser or the JavaScript engine.
When an object (like an array) is no longer referenced by any variable or data structure, it becomes
eligible for garbage collection. This means that the memory allocated to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] may be reclaimed 
at some point in the future when the garbage collector runs, freeing up resources for other parts of your 
application.
